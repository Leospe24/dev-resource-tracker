# Developer Resource Tracker

A fullstack MERN application I built to organize and track learning resources. This project demonstrates my ability to take an idea from concept to deployed application.

## 🚀 Live Application
- **Frontend:** https://dev-resource-tracker-api.netlify.app
- **Backend API:** https://dev-resource-tracker-api.onrender.com/api/resources

## 💡 Why I Built This
I kept losing track of tutorials, articles, and courses I wanted to study. Instead of using scattered bookmarks, I built this application to centralize my learning resources with priority levels and completion tracking.

## 🛠️ What I Learned
- Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express
- React state management and modern hooks  
- MongoDB database design with Mongoose
- Deployment and environment configuration
- Responsive UI design with Tailwind CSS

## 📦 Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Axios
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
**Deployment:** Netlify, Render, MongoDB Atlas

## 🎯 Features
- Add, edit, and delete learning resources
- Set priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Mark resources as complete
- Responsive design for all devices
- Real-time UI updates
